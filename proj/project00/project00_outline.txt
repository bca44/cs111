The program should prompt the user for an input file that contains the grade data.

The program should then read in all the grades for the labs, homework assignments, projects and exams provided in the file
    and calculate a grade for the student based on
    the submitted assignments and the grading policy specified in the syllabus.

Once the grade is calculated, the program should print out a message indicating
    the student's percentages in each category (Labs, Homework, etc.).
    It should then display the student's overall percentage
    and letter grade in the class
    and then exit.
