    make list of indices
    for each index:
        if even
            multipy ith element by its index
            add to new list
        return list

couple
    make list of indices
    for each index i:
        grab s[ i ] and t[ i ] and add [s[ i ] , t[ i ] ] to new list
    return list
    BETTER - make a list comprehension

copy_file
    read lines of input_file
    make list of indices - length of lines in input_file
    write f:"{i}: {input_lines[ i ]}" to output_file
